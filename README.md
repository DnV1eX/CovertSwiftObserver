# SwiftObserver
#### TODO:
- [ ] Default __Parameter__ to __Void__ (when supported in Swift)
- [ ] Pass __Object__ as `run` closure first argument
- [ ] `bind` to __Parameter__ with __KeyPath__ (if supported by generics)
- [ ] Try to refactor _till_ and _once_ parameters as __Handler__ mutating functions
